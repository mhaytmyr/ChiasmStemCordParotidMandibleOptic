    Objective:
        a. I realized stratifying helps to classify under-represented class. In this experiment I am going to
        combine this technique with weighted loss.

    Results:
        modelName = 1x256x384_Strat_WeightedLoss_3D16_3D32_3D64_3D128_3D256_3D512_1C1024
        number of epochs: 100
        batch size: 8
	
	loss: 0.0154 - {'dice_4':0.76, 'dice_1':0.43, 'dice_2':0.82, 'dice_5':0.82, 'dice_6':0.45, 'dice_3':0.75}
	val_loss: 0.0141 - val_dice_1: 0.0202 - val_dice_2: 0.2061 - val_dice_3: 0.5569 - val_dice_4: 0.1654 - val_dice_5: 0.2201 - val_dice_6: 0.0257

    Val Results:
        ('chiasm', 0.575), ('brainstem', 0.753), ('cord', 0.713), ('parotid', 0.642), ('mandible', 0.802), ('opric nerve', 0.495)

    Obervations: I am not sure if I used weighted loss function in this case sice training file showed that 
    there was "categorical_cross_entropy" instead of "weighted_logarithm_loss"

    Objective:

    a. I am trying to improve classification of under-represented class by stratifying batches.
        i) Find indices which contain labels before training phase
        ii) Ensure each batch contains at least one class
    Following are results.
    
    Results:
        modelName = 1x256x384_Stratified_3D16_3D32_3D64_3D128_3D256_3D512_1C1024
        number of epochs: 100
        batch size: 8, before it was 4
        training time: 1365 seconds
        
        loss: 0.0155 - {'dice_2': 0.83,'dice_4':0.75,'dice_3':0.76, 'dice_1':0.43,'dice_6': 0.39, 'dice_5':0.81}
        val_loss: 0.0140 - val_dice_1: 0.0224 - val_dice_2: 0.2104 - val_dice_3: 0.5276 - val_dice_4: 0.1240 - val_dice_5: 0.2145 - val_dice_6: 0.0195

    Val Results:
	    ('chiasm', 0.472), ('brainstem', 0.745), ('cord', 0.690), ('parotid', 0.613), ('mandible', 0.775), ('optic nerve', 0.583)
        
    Observations:
        Contours look reasonable, true mandible is missing in some slices. Optical nerve and chiasm are segmented well.
        It seems oversampling under-represented class is helping in this case. I might try combining 
        two methods, where I also add weighted loss. Loss of train and val are similar indicating less overfitting.

    Objective:


    b. In the previous training I realized chiasm and optic nerve are not learning anything so I weighted classes as follows:
        i) Find total number of classes within training ROI
        ii) Divide it with each class; tot_classes/each_class
        iii) Take logarithm of this ratio and set lowest value to one
    Following are results.
    
    Results:
        modelName = 1x256x384_WeightedLoss_3D16_3D32_3D64_3D128_3D256_3D512_1C1024
        number of epochs: 76
        training time: 625 seconds        
        loss: 0.0127 {'dice_1': 0.496, 'dice_2': 0.856, 'dice_3': 0.829, 'dice_4': 0.828, 'dice_5': 0.853, 'dice_6': 0.533}
        val_loss: 0.0633 - val_dice_1: 0.0128 - val_dice_2: 0.1733 - val_dice_3: 0.5059 - val_dice_4: 0.1153 - val_dice_5: 0.1735 - val_dice_6: 0.0152

    Val Results:
        ('chiasm', 0.405), ('brainstem', 0.731), ('cord', 0.682), ('parotid', 0.613), ('mandible', 0.784), ('opric nerve', 0.450)
        
    Observations:
        Contours look reasonable, sometimes parotid and mandible are missing. Optical nerve and chiasm are oversegmented. Which is acceptable now.

    a. Started training Head and Neck patients. Found a nice database at
    https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=39879146. This data collection contains three dimensional high-resolution 
    (3D) fan-beam CT scans collected during pre-treatment, mid-treatment, and post-treatment using a Siemens 16-slice CT scanner with standard 
    clinical protocol for 31 head-and-neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients. In total we have collected 93 patients. 
    Our goal is to segment following OAR chiasm, breainstem, spinal cord, mandible, parotid and optical nerve. 

    Pre-processing: Some of the patients were missing contours for optical nerve and chiasm. Hence, we reduced dataset to the ones that had all 
        contours. At the end there were about 7300 training and 1600 testing CT slices. I use same pre-procesing which I used for prostate
        contouring with standard normalization and center cropping. I haven't changed model, would like to see how much generlization I can
        accomplish. 
        One of the problems is dataset is huge and augmenting+shuffling took too much time to train. Hence, I tried removing shuffling but
        that produced periodic loss, which would go up till the end of epoch and go down again. Then, I removed augmentation which reduced 
        training time from ~2200 seconds to ~600 seconds. For now, I will stick to this and see how things progress. 

    Results:
        modelName = "1x256x384_UNet_3D16_3D32_3D64_3D128_3D256_3D512_1C1024"
        number of ecpochs: 20
        loss: 0.0098 {'dice_1': 0.0, 'dice_2': 0.79, 'dice_3': 0.7342, 'dice_4': 0.7284, 'dice_5': 0.8061, 'dice_6': 0.0}
        val_loss: 0.0124 - val_dice_1: 0 - val_dice_2: 0.1658 - val_dice_3: 0.4500 - val_dice_4: 0.1377 - val_dice_5: 0.3137 - val_dice_6: 0.0

    Val Results:
        ('chiasm', nan), ('brainstem', 0.69374847), ('cord', 0.66598022), ('parotid', 0.59737486), ('mandible', 0.79049456), ('opric nerve', nan)
    Observations:
        I didn't see any improvement after 20th epoch, so decided to sop there. I would like to add weights to balance classes.
